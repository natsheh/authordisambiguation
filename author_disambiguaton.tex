% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in

% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.


\usepackage{xspace}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\newcommand{\etal}{\emph{et al.}\xspace}
\newcommand{\ie}{\emph{i.e.}\xspace}
\newcommand{\eg}{\emph{e.g.}\xspace}
\newcommand{\Eg}{\emph{E.g.}\xspace}



% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with

  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics

% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

Author name disambiguation in bibliographic databases is the problem of
grouping together scientific publications written by the same person, accounting
for potential homonyms and/or synonyms.
Among solutions to this problem, digital libraries are increasingly offering tools
for authors to manually curate their publications and claim those that are theirs.
Indirectly, these tools allow for the inexpensive collection of large annotated training
data, which can be further leveraged to build a complementary automated
disambiguation system capable of inferring patterns for identifying
publications written by the same person.
Building on more than 1 million publicly released crowdsourced annotations,
we propose an automated author disambiguation solution exploiting this data (i) to learn
an accurate classifier for identifying coreferring authors and (ii) to guide the clustering
of scientific publications by distinct authors in a semi-supervised way.
To the best of our knowledge, our analysis is the first to be carried out on data of
this size and coverage.
With respect to the state of the art, we validate the general pipeline used in most existing
solutions, and improve by: (i) proposing phonetic-based blocking strategies, thereby
increasing recall; and (ii) adding strong ethnicity-sensitive features for learning a linkage
function, thereby tailoring disambiguation to non-Western author names whenever necessary.

\section{Introduction}
In academic digital libraries, author name disambiguation is the problem of
grouping together publications written by the same person.
Author name disambiguation is often a difficult problem because an author may use different
spellings or name variants across their career (synonymy) and/or distinct authors may
share the same name (polysemy).
Most notably, author disambiguation is often more troublesome for researchers
from non-Western cultures, where personal names may be traditionally less diverse (leading to
homonym issues) or for which transliteration to Latin characters may not be unique (leading to
synonym issues).
With the fast growth of the scientific literature, author disambiguation has become a pressing
issue since the accuracy of information managed at the level of individuals directly affects:
the relevance search of results (\eg, when querying for all publications written by a given author);
the reliability of bibliometrics and author rankings (\eg, citation counts or other impact
metrics, as studied in \cite{strotmann2012author}); and/or the relevance of scientific network analysis
\cite{newman2001structure}.

Efforts and solutions to author disambiguation have been proposed from various
communities \cite{liu2014author}. On the one hand, libraries have maintained
authorship control through manual curation, either in a centralized way by
hiring professional collaborators or through developing services that invite authors to register
their publications themselves (\eg, Google Scholar or Inspire-HEP).
Recent efforts to create persistent digital identifiers assigned to researchers (\eg, ORCID or ResearcherID),
with the objective to embed these identifiers in the submission workflow of publishers
or repositories (\eg, Elsevier, arXiv or Inspire-HEP), would univocally solve any disambiguation issue.
With the large cost of centralized manual authorship control, or until crowdsourced solutions are more
widely adopted, the impact of these efforts are unfortunately limited by the efficiency, motivation
and integrity of their active contributors. Similarly, the success of persistent digital identifier efforts
is conditioned to a large and ubiquitous adoption by both researchers and publishers.
For these reasons, fully automated machine learning-based methods have been proposed during the past decade to
provide immediate, less costly, and satisfactory solutions to author
disambiguation. In this work, our goal is to explore and demonstrate how both
approaches can coexist and benefit from each other.
In particular, we study how labeled data obtained through manual curation (either centralized or
crowdsourced) can be exploited (i) to learn an accurate classifier for
identifying coreferring authors, and (ii) to guide the clustering of scientific
publications by distinct authors in a semi-supervised way.
Our analysis of parameters and features of this large dataset reveal that the general pipeline
commonly used in existing solutions is an effective approach for author disambiguation.
Additionally, we propose alternative strategies for blocking based on the
phonetization of author names to increase recall.

The remainder of this report is structured as follows. In Section~\ref{related-works},
we briefly review machine learning solutions for author disambiguation.
The components of our method are then defined in Section~\ref{methods}. Experiments
are carried out in Section~\ref{experiments}, where we explore and validate
features for the supervised learning of a linkage function and compare
strategies for the semi-supervised clustering of publications.
Finally, conclusions and future works are discussed in Section~\ref{conclusions}.

% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.

\section{Related work}
\label{related-works}

As reviewed in \cite{smalheiser2009author,ferreira2012brief,levin2012citation}, author
disambiguation algorithms are usually composed of two main components: (i) a
linkage function determining whether two publications have been written by the
same author; and (ii) a clustering algorithm producing clusters of publications
assumed to be written by the same author.
Approaches can be classified along several axes, depending on the type and
amount of data available, the way the linkage function is learned or defined, or the
clustering procedure used to group publications.
Methods relying on supervised learning usually make use of a small set of hand-labeled pairs
of publications identified as being either from the same or different authors to automatically learn a linkage
function between publications \cite{culotta2007author,treeratpituk2009disambiguating,tran2014author}.

Training data is usually not easily available, therefore unsupervised approaches propose
the use of domain-specific, manually designed, linkage functions tailored towards author
disambiguation \cite{malin2005unsupervised, song2007efficient,
soler2007separating, kang2009co, schulz2014exploiting}.
These approaches have the advantage of not requiring hand-labeled data, but generally do
not perform as well as supervised approaches.
To reconcile both worlds, semi-supervised methods make use of small, manually verified, clusters of
publications and/or high-precision domain-specific rules to build a training
set of pairs of publications, from which a linkage function is then built using supervised learning
\cite{ferreira2010effective,torvik2009author,levin2012citation}.

Semi-supervised approaches also allow for the tuning of the
clustering algorithm when the latter is applied to a mixed set of labeled
and unlabeled publications, \eg, by maximizing some clustering performance
metric on the known clusters \cite{levin2012citation}.

Due to the lack of large and publicly available datasets of curated
clusters of publications, studies on author disambiguation are usually
constrained to validating their results on manually built datasets of limited
size and scope (from a few hundred to a few thousand papers, with sparse
coverage of ambiguous cases), making the true performance of these methods
often difficult to assess with high confidence.
Additionally, despite devoted efforts to construct them, these datasets are rarely public,
making it even more difficult to compare methods using a common benchmark.

In this context, we position the work in this paper as a
semi-supervised solution for author disambiguation, with the significant
advantage of having a very large collection of more than 1 million crowdsourced annotations
of publications whose true authors are identified.
The extent and coverage of this data allows us to revisit, validate and nuance previous
findings regarding supervised learning of linkage functions, and to better explore strategies
for semi-supervised clustering.
Furthermore, by releasing our data in the public domain, we hope to provide a benchmark on
which further research on author disambiguation and related topics can be built.



% Methods =====================================================================

\section{Semi-supervised author disambiguation}
\label{methods}

Formally, let us assume a set of publications ${\cal P} = \{ p_0, ...,
p_{N-1}\}$ along with the set of unique individuals ${\cal A} = \{ a_0, ...,
a_{M-1}\}$ having together authored all publications in ${\cal P}$.  Let us
define a signature $s \in p$ from a publication as a unique piece of
information identifying one of the authors of $p$ (\eg, the author name, his
affiliation, along with any other metadata that can be derived from $p$, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:signature}). Let us
denote by ${\cal S} = \{ s | s \in p, p \in {\cal P} \}$ the set of all
signatures that can be extracted from all publications in ${\cal P}$.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fig-pub-to-signature}
\caption{An example signature $s$ for "Doe, John". A \textit{signature} is
defined as unique piece of information identifying an author on a publication,
along with any other metadata that can be derived from it, such as publication
title, co-authors or date of publication.}
\label{fig:signature}
\end{figure}

In this
framework, author disambiguation can be stated as the problem of
finding a partition ${\cal C} = \{ c_0, ..., c_{M-1} \}$ of ${\cal S}$ such
that ${\cal S} = \cup_{i=0}^{M-1} c_i$, $c_i \cap c_j = \phi$ for all $i \neq
j$, and where subsets $c_i$, or clusters, each corresponds to the set of all
signatures belonging to the same individual $a_i$. Alternatively, the set
${\cal A}$ may remain (possibly partially) unknown, such that author
disambiguation boils down to finding a partition ${\cal C}$ where
subsets $c_i$  each correspond to the set of all signatures from the same
individual (without knowing who). Finally, in the case of partially annotated databases as studied in
this work, the set extends with the partial knowledge ${\cal C}^\prime = \{ c_0^\prime, ..., c_{M-1}^\prime \}$ of ${\cal C}$,
such that $c_i^\prime \subseteq c_i$, where $c_i^\prime$ may be empty.
Or put otherwise, the set extends with the assumption that all signatures
$s \in c_i^\prime$ belong to the same author.

Inspired by several previous works described in Section~\ref{related-works},
we cast in this work author disambiguation into a semi-supervised clustering
problem.
Our algorithm is composed of three parts, as sketched in Figure~\ref{fig:workflow}: (i) a blocking
scheme whose goal is to roughly pre-cluster signatures ${\cal S}$ into smaller groups in order to
reduce computational complexity; (ii) the construction of a linkage function
$d$ between signatures using supervised learning; and (iii) the
semi-supervised clustering of all signatures within the same block, using $d$ as a pseudo distance metric.


\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fig-workflow}
\caption{Pipeline for author disambiguation: (a)
signatures are \textit{blocked} to reduce computational complexity, (b) a linkage
function is built with supervised learning, (c) independently within each block, signatures
are grouped using hierarchical agglomerative clustering.}
\label{fig:workflow}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Blocking}
\label{methods:blocking}

As in previous works, the first part of our algorithm consists of dividing
signatures ${\cal S}$ into disjoint subsets ${\cal S}_{b_0}, ..., {\cal
S}_{b_{K-1}}$, or \textit{blocks} \cite{fellegi69}, followed by carrying out
author disambiguation on each one of these blocks independently.
By doing so, the computational complexity of clustering (see Section~\ref{methods:clustering})
typically reduces from $O(|{\cal S}|^2)$ to $O(\sum_b |{\cal S}_b|^2)$, which is much more
tractable as the number of signatures increases.
Since disambiguation is performed independently per block, a good blocking strategy should be
designed such that signatures from the same author are all mapped to the same
block, otherwise their correct clustering would not be possible in later stages of the workflow.
As a result, blocking should be a balance between reduced complexity and maximum recall.

The simplest and most common strategy for blocking, referred to hereon in as \textit{Surname and First Initial (SFI)},
groups signatures together if they share the same surname(s) and the same first
given name initial (\eg, \emph{SFI}("Doe, John") $==$ "Doe, J").
Despite satisfactory performance, there are several cases where this simple strategy fails to cluster related pairs of signatures together, including:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item There are different
  ways of writing an author name, or signatures contain a typo
  (\eg, "Mueller, R." and "Muller, R.", "Tchaikovsky, P." and "Czajkowski, P.").

  \item An author has multiple surnames and some signatures place the first part of the surname within the given names (\eg, "Martinez Torres, A." and "Torres, A. Martinez").

  \item An author has multiple surnames and, on some signatures, only the first surname is
  present (\eg, "Smith-Jones, A." and "Smith, A.")

  \item An author has multiple given names and they are not always all recorded (\eg,
  "Smith, Jack" and "Smith, A. J.")

  \item An authors surname changed (\eg, due to marriage).
\end{enumerate}

To account for these issues we propose instead to block signatures based on the
phonetic representation of the normalized surname.
Normalization involves stripping accents (\eg, "Jab?o?ski, ?" $\rightarrow$ "Jablonski, L") and name
affixes that inconsistently appear in signatures (\eg, "van der Waals, J. D."
$\rightarrow$ "Waals, J. D."), while phonetization is based either on the
Double Metaphone \cite{doublemetaphone}, the NYSIIS \cite{nysiis} or the
Soundex \cite{Soundex} phonetic algorithms for mapping author names to their pronunciations.
Together, these processing steps allow for grouping of most name variants of the same
person in the same block with a small increase in the overall computational complexity, thereby solving case 1.

In the case of multiple surnames (cases 2 and 3), we propose to block
signatures in two phases.
In the first phase, all the signatures with a single surname are clustered together.
Every different surname token creates a new block.
In the second phase, the signatures with multiple surnames are compared
with the blocks for the first and last surname.
If the first surnames of an author were already used as the last given names on some of the signatures, the
new signature is assigned to the block of the last surname (case 2).
Otherwise, the signature is assigned to the block of the first surname (case 3).
Finally, to prevent the creation of too large blocks, signatures are further divided
along their first given name initial.
Cases 4 and 5 are not explicitly handled.

\subsection{Linkage function}
\label{methods:linkage}

\textit{Supervised classification.} The second part of the algorithm is the
automatic construction of a pair-wise linkage function between signatures for use
during the clustering step which groups all signatures from the same author.

Formally, the goal is to build a function $d: {\cal S} \times {\cal S} \mapsto
[0, 1]$, such that $d(s_1, s_2)$ approaches $0$ if both signatures $s_1$ and
$s_2$ belong to the same author, and $1$ otherwise.
This problem can be cast as a standard supervised classification task, where inputs
are pairs of signatures and outputs are classes $0$ (same authors), and $1$
(distinct authors). In this work, we evaluate Random Forests (RF, \cite{breiman2001random}),
Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT, \cite{friedman2001greedy}),
and Logistic Regression \cite{fan2008liblinear} as classifiers.

\textit{Input features.} In most cases, supervised learning algorithms assume
the input space ${\cal X}$ to be numeric (\eg, $\mathbb{R}^p$), making them
not directly applicable to structured input spaces such as ${\cal S} \times
{\cal S}$.
Following previous works, pairs of signatures $(s_1, s_2)$ are first transformed to vectors $v \in \mathbb{R}^p$
by building so-called similarity profiles \cite{treeratpituk2009disambiguating} on which supervised learning is carried out.
In this work, we design and evaluate fifteen standard input
features based on the comparison of signature fields, as reported in the first
half of Table~\ref{table:features}.
As an illustrative example, the \textit{Full name} feature corresponds to the similarity between the (full)
author name fields of the two signatures, as measured using as combination
operator the cosine similarity between their respective $(n,m)$-\emph{TF-IDF} vector
representations\footnote{$(n,m)$ denotes that the \emph{TF-IDF} vectors are computed
from character $n$, $n+1$, ..., $m$-grams.
When not specified, \emph{TF-IDF} vectors are otherwise computed from words.}.
Similarly, the \textit{Year difference} feature measures the absolute difference between the publication date of the
articles to which the two signatures respectively belong.

%\glnote{Add a few examples of transformed pairs?}

\textit{Building a training set.} The distinctive aspect of our work is the
knowledge of more than 1 million crowdsourced annotations ${\cal C}^\prime = \{
c_0^\prime, ..., c_{M-1}^\prime \}$, indicating together that all signature $s \in
c_i^\prime$ are known to correspond to the same individual $a_i$.
In particular, this data can be used to generate positive pairs $(x=(s_1, s_2), y=0)$ for all
$s_1, s_2 \in c_i^\prime$, for all $i$. Similarly, negative pairs $(x=(s_1,
s_2), y=1)$ can be extracted for all $s_1 \in c_i^\prime, s_2 \in c_j^\prime$, for
all $i \neq j$.

The most straightforward approach for building a training set on which to learn
a linkage function is to sample an equal number of positive and negative pairs,
as suggested above.
By observing that the linkage function $d$ will eventually
be used only on pairs of signatures from the same block $S_b$, a further
refinement for building a training set is to restrict positive and negative
pairs $(s_1, s_2)$ to only those for which $s_1$ and $s_2$ belong to the same
block. In doing so, the trained classifier is forced to learn intra-block
discriminative patterns rather than inter-block differences.
Furthermore, as noted in \cite{lange2011frequency}, most signature pairs are non-ambiguous:
if both signatures share the same author names, then
they correspond to the same individual, otherwise they do not.
Rather than sampling pairs uniformly at random, we propose to oversample
difficult cases when building the training set (\ie, pairs of signatures with
different author names corresponding to same individual, and pairs of
signatures with identical author names but corresponding to distinct
individuals) in order to improve the overall accuracy of the linkage function.

\subsection{Semi-supervised clustering}
\label{methods:clustering}

The last component of our author disambiguation pipeline is clustering, that is
the process of grouping together, within a block, all signatures from the same
individual (and only those).
As for many other works on author disambiguation, we make use of hierarchical clustering \cite{ward1963hierarchical} for
building clusters of signatures in a bottom-up fashion.
The method involves iteratively merging together the two most similar clusters until all clusters
are merged together at the top of the hierarchy.
Similarity between clusters is evaluated using either complete, single or average linkage, using
as a pseudo-distance metric the probability that $s_1$ and $s_2$ correspond to
distinct authors, as calculated from the custom linkage function $d$ from Section \ref{methods:linkage}.

To form flat clusters from the hierarchy, one must decide on a maximum
distance threshold above which clusters are considered to correspond to
distinct authors.
Let us denote by ${\cal S}^\prime = \{ s | s \in c^\prime, c^\prime
\in {\cal C}^\prime \}$ the set of all signatures for which partial clusters are
known.
Let us also denote by $\smash{\widehat{\cal C}}$ the predicted clusters for all signatures in ${\cal S}$, and by
$\smash{\widehat{\cal C}^\prime} = \{ \widehat{c} \cap {\cal S}^\prime | \widehat{c} \in \widehat{\cal C} \}$
the predicted clusters restricted to signatures for which partial clusters are known.
From these, we evaluate the following semi-supervised cut-off strategies, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:cuts}:
\begin{itemize}

\item \textit{No cut:} all signatures from the same block are assumed to be from the same author.

\item \textit{Global cut:} the threshold is chosen globally over all blocks,
    as the one maximizing some score $f({\cal C}^\prime, \widehat{\cal C}^\prime)$.

\item \textit{Block cut:} the threshold is chosen locally at each block $b$,
    as the one maximizing some score $f({\cal C}_b^\prime, \widehat{\cal C}_b^\prime)$.
    In case ${\cal C}_b^\prime$ is empty, then all signatures from $b$ are clustered together.
\end{itemize}

\section{Experiments}
\label{experiments}

\subsection{Data}

The author disambiguation solution proposed in this work, along with its
enhancements, are evaluated on data extracted from the \emph{INSPIRE} portal
\cite{gentil2009information}, a digital library for scientific literature in
high-energy physics.
Overall, the portal holds more than 1 million publications ${\cal P}$,
forming in total a set ${\cal S}$ of more than 10 million signatures.
Out of these, around 13\% have been \textit{claimed} by their
original authors, marked as such by professional curators or automatically assigned to their true authors thanks
to persistent identifiers provided by publishers or other sources.
Together, they constitute a trusted set $({\cal S}^\prime, {\cal C}^\prime)$ of 15388 distinct individuals sharing
36340 unique author names spread within 1201763 signatures on 360066
publications. This data covers several decades in time and dozens of author
nationalities worldwide.

Following the \emph{INSPIRE} terms of use, the signatures ${\cal S}^\prime$ and their
corresponding clusters ${\cal C}^\prime$ are released
online\footnote{\url{https://github.com/glouppe/paper-author-disambiguation}}
under the CC0 license.
To the best of our knowledge, data of this size and coverage is the first to be publicly
released in the scope of author disambiguation research.

\subsection{Evaluation protocol}

Experiments carried out to study the impact of the proposed algorithmic
components and refinements, as described in Section~\ref{methods}, follow a
standard 3-fold cross-validation protocol, using $({\cal S}^\prime, {\cal
C}^\prime)$ as ground-truth dataset. To replicate the $|{\cal S}^\prime| /
|{\cal S}| \approx 13\%$ ratio of claimed signatures with respect to the total
set of signatures, as on the INSPIRE platform, cross-validation folds are
constructed by sampling 13\% of claimed signatures to form a training set ${\cal
S}_\text{train}^\prime \subseteq {\cal S}^\prime$.
The remaining signatures ${\cal S}_\text{test}^\prime = {\cal S}^\prime \setminus {\cal
S}_\text{train}^\prime$ are used for testing.
Therefore, ${\cal C}_\text{train}^\prime = \{ c^\prime \cap {\cal S}_\text{train}^\prime | c^\prime \in {\cal C}^\prime
\}$ represents the partial known clusters on the training fold, while ${\cal
C}_\text{test}^\prime$ are those used for testing.

As commonly performed in author disambiguation research,
we evaluate the predicted clusters over testing data  ${\cal C}_\text{test}^\prime$,
using pairwise precision, recall
and F-measure, as defined below:

\begin{align}
P_\text{pairwise}({\cal C}, \widehat{\cal C}) &= \frac{|p({\cal C}) \cap p(\widehat{\cal C})|}{|p(\widehat{\cal C})|}\\
R_\text{pairwise}({\cal C}, \widehat{\cal C}) &= \frac{|p({\cal C}) \cap p(\widehat{\cal C})|}{|p({\cal C})|}\\
F_\text{pairwise}({\cal C}, \widehat{\cal C}) &= \frac{2 P_\text{pairwise}({\cal C}, \widehat{\cal C}) R_\text{pairwise}({\cal C}, \widehat{\cal C})}{P_\text{pairwise}({\cal C}, \widehat{\cal C}) + R_\text{pairwise}({\cal C}, \widehat{\cal C})}
\end{align}

and where $c(s)$ (resp. $\widehat{c}(s)$) is the cluster $c \in {\cal C}$ such that
$s \in c$ (resp. the cluster $\widehat{c} \in \widehat{\cal C}$ such that $s
\in \widehat{c}$), and where $p({\cal C}) = \cup_{c \in {\cal C}} \{ (s_1, s_2)
| s_1, s_2 \in c, s_1 \neq s_2 \}$ is the set of all pairs of signatures from
the same clusters in ${\cal C}$.
Precision evaluates whether signatures are grouped only with signatures from the same true clusters,
while recall measures the extent to which all signatures from the same true clusters are
effectively grouped together.
The F-measure is the harmonic mean between these two quantities.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textit{Baseline.} Results presented in Table~\ref{table:results} are discussed with
respect to a baseline solution using the following combination of components:
\begin{itemize}
\item Blocking: same surname and the same first given name initial strategy (SFI);
\item Linkage function: all 15 features defined in Table~\ref{table:features},
    gradient boosted regression trees as supervised learning algorithm
    and a training set of pairs built from $({\cal S}_\text{train}^\prime, {\cal C}_\text{train}^\prime)$, by balancing easy and difficult cases.
\item Clustering: agglomerative clustering using average linkage and
    block cuts found to maximize $F_\text{B3}({\cal C}_\text{train}^\prime, \widehat{\cal C}_\text{train}^\prime, {\cal S}_\text{train}^\prime)$.
\end{itemize}


\textit{Blocking.} The good precision of the baseline ($0.9948$), but its
lower recall ($0.9738$) suggest that the blocking strategy might be the
limiting factor to further overall improvements.
As shown in Table~\ref{table:blocking}, the maximum recall (\ie, if within a block, all signatures were clustered optimally) for SFI is $0.9776$.
At the price of fewer and therefore slightly larger blocks (as reported in the right column of Table~\ref{table:blocking}), the
proposed phonetic-based blocking strategies show better maximum recall ($0.9862$ in average), thereby pushing further the upper bound on the maximum
performance of author disambiguation.
Let us remind however that the reported maximum recalls for the blocking strategies using phonetization are
also raised due to the better handling of multiple surnames, as described in Section \ref{methods:blocking}.

As Table~\ref{table:results} shows, switching to either Double metaphone or NYSIIS phonetic-based blocking allows
to improve the overall F-measure score, trading precision for recall.
In particular, the NYSIIS-based phonetic blocking shows to be the most effective when applied
to the baseline (with an F-measure of $0.9875$) while also being the most
efficient computationally (with 10857 blocks versus 12978 for the baseline).

Finally, let us also note that Table~\ref{table:blocking} corroborates the
estimation of \cite{torvik2009author}, stating that SFI blocking has a recall
around $98\%$ on real data.

\begin{table}
\caption{Maximum recall $R_\text{pairwise}^*$ of blocking strategies, and their number of blocks on ${\cal S}^\prime$.}

    Double metaphone & 0.9863 & 9753 \\
    NYSIIS & 0.9861 & 10857 \\
    Soundex & 0.9863 & 9403 \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}



\textit{Name normalization.} As discussed previously, the seemingly insignificant step of
normalizing author names (stripping accents, removing affixes), as performed in the
baseline, is shown to be important. Results from Table~\ref{table:results} clearly suggest that not
normalizing significantly reduces performance (yielding an F-measure of $0.9842$ when normalizing,
but decreasing to $0.9793$ when raw author name strings are used instead).

\textit{Linkage function.} Let us first comment on the results regarding the
supervised algorithm used to learn the linkage function.
As Table~\ref{table:results} indicates, both tree-based algorithms ($0.9842$ for GBRT
and $0.9854$ for Random Forests) appear to be
significantly better fit than Linear Regression ($0.9643$). This result is
consistent with \cite{treeratpituk2009disambiguating} which evaluated the use of
Random Forests for author disambiguation, but contradicts results of
\cite{levin2012citation} for which Logistic Regression appeared to be the best
classifier.
Provided hyper-parameters are properly tuned, the superiority of
tree-based methods is in our opinion not surprising.
Indeed, given the fact that the optimal linkage function is likely to be non-linear, non-parametric
methods are expected to yield better results, as the experiments here confirm.

Second, properly constructing a training set of positive and negative pairs of
signatures from which to learn a linkage function yields a significant
improvement.
A random sampling of positive and negative pairs, without taking
blocking into account, significantly impacts the overall performance
($0.9692$). When pairs are drawn only fom blocks, performance increases
($0.9778$), which confirms our intuition that $d$ should be built only from
pairs it will be used to eventually cluster. Finally, making the classification
problem more difficult by oversampling complex cases proves to be relevant,
by further improving the disambiguation results ($0.9842$).

\textit{Semi-supervised clustering.} The last part of our experiment concerns
the study of agglomerative clustering and the best way to find a cut-off
threshold to form clusters. Results from Table~\ref{table:results}
first clearly indicate that average linkage is significantly better than
both single and complete linkage.

Clustering together all signatures from the same block is the least effective
strategy ($0.8977$), which is a not bad accuracy, given the
fact it requires almost no computation (\ie, both learning a linkage function
and running agglomerative clustering can be skipped -- only the blocking
function is needed to group signatures). In particular, this result reveals
that author names are not ambiguous in most cases\footnote{This holds for the
data we extracted, but may in the future, with the rise of non-Western
researchers, be an underestimate of the ambiguous cases.} and that only a small
fraction of them requires advanced disambiguation procedures. On the other
hand, both global and block cut thresholding strategies give very good results,
with a slight advantage for block cuts ($0.9832$ versus $0.9842$), as expected.
In case ${\cal S}^\prime_b$ is empty (\eg, because it corresponds to a young
researcher at the beginning of his career), this therefore suggests that either using
a cut-off threshold learned globally from the known data or using SFI would in general give
satisfactory results, only marginally worse than if claimed signatures had been
known.Trying out 3 clustering methods, the results show that \textit {average linkage} was the best one.

\textit{Combined best settings.} When all best settings are combined (\ie,
Blocking = NYSIIS, Name normalization, Classifier = Random Forests, Training
pairs = blocked and balanced, Clustering = Average linkage, Block cuts),
performance reaches $0.9879$, \ie, the best of all reported results. In particular,
this combination exhibits both the high recall of phonetic blocking based on the NYSIIS algorithm
and the high precision of Random Forests.


\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusions}

In this work, we have revisited and validated the general author disambiguation
pipeline introduced in previous independent research work.
The generic approach is composed of three components, whose design and tuning are all critical
to good performance: (i) a blocking function for pre-clustering signatures
and reducing computational complexity, (ii) a linkage function for identifying
signatures with coreferring authors and (iii) the agglomerative clustering of
signatures. Making use of a distinctively large dataset of more than 1 million
crowdsourced annotations, we experimentally study all three components and
propose further improvements. With regards to blocking, we suggest to use
phonetization of author names to increase recall while maintaining low
computational complexity. For the linkage function, we mainly applied typical text-based feature extraction. Finally, we explore semi-supervised cut-off
threshold strategies for agglomerative clustering. For all three components,
experiments show that our refinements all yield significantly better author
disambiguation accuracy.

Overall, these results all encourage further improvements and research. For
blocking, one of the open challenges is to manage signatures with inconsistent
surnames or inconsistent first given names (cases 4 and 5, as described in
Section~\ref{methods:blocking}) while maintaining blocks to a tractable size.
As phonetic algorithms are not yet perfect, another direction  for further work is the design of better
phonetization functions, tailored for author disambiguation. For the linkage function.

As part of this study, we also publicly release the annotated data extracted
from the \emph{INSPIRE} platform, on which our experiments are based.
To the best of our knowledge, data of this size and coverage is the first to be
available in author disambiguation research. By releasing the data publicly,
we hope to provide the basis for further research on author disambiguation
and related topics.
